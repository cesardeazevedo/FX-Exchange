Opening a trading account at the exchange is easy, fast and free. Click “sign up” , fill out the form and log in.  After your login, the exchange operator will require your personal name, address and documentation. After your documentation is verified by the exchange operator your account will be credited with a bonus in your local currency. From that point you are all set to buy your first bitcoin!
