&lt;p&gt;Yes. On the main menu go to “ledger” where a record of all the transactions is kept. You can also check your history of deposits and withdrawals by going to the main menu and clicking either on “deposits” or “withdrawals”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Both public keys for the hot and cold wallets are available for auditing. All you have to do is go to blockchain.info and enter the adress you want to check out.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Where is your bank account information?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to deposit funds into the exchange, the operator team has to verify your bank account. Once that process has been made you can deposit your funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the necessary bank information will pop up in a new window when you request a deposit order on the main menu.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Who pays the withdrawal fee?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In both cases of withdrawing FIAT or BTC the fees are on the trader’s side. FIAT fees are established by the broker. BTC fees are established by the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>What is the instant deposit mode?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a feature of the exchange that enables trusted and verified users to start trading even though the FIAT deposit hasn’t still been verified by the broker. The account of the user gets credited without the need of waiting for deposit confirmations.&lt;/p&gt;
