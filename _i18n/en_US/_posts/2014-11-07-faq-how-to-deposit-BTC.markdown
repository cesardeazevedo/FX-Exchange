On the main menu, click on “Deposit BTC” and a new window will appear. The platform generates a unique address that will only be valid for that specific transaction and with a time limit to perform the deposit. Scan the QR code and send the BTC. After blockchain confirmation you will see the amount of BTC you sent credited into your trader account. No fees are charged for depositing BTC except from the one required by the blockchain to confirm the transaction. IMPORTANT: Never save the deposit address, never reuse the same address or your deposits won’t be confirmed.
