On the main menu, click on “Deposit local currency” and a new window will appear. You will have to specify the amount of FIAT you want to deposit in order to buy bitcoins. Have in mind that the broker will charge you a fee every time you wish to make a deposit. In a deposit of $800 with a fee of 1.65% you will see $786.8 credited on your balance.
