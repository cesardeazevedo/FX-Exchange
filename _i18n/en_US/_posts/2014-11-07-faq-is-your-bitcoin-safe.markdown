Our main concern is to allow traders to interact within a safe environment. Bitcoins are stored in a multisignature cold storage wallet and away from the servers of the exchange. So even though if the server of the exchange has been hacked the bitcoins are out of the reach of the bad boys.

The multisignature wallet requires 2 out of 3 signatures in order to be able to move the bitcoins.
 the exchange operator holds one of the 3 keys. The other 2 are held by BlinkTrade and a mediator who will take part of the process in case there is a dispute between the exchange operator and BlinkTrade.

This means that even though a hacker compromises the servers of the exchange, he will also have to compromise the servers of BlinkTrade to be able to take the bitcoins. The odds are extremely low for that to happen.

Each time the bitcoins have to be moved from the multisignature wallet to the hot wallet (which is connected to the internet for processing fast withdrawals) BlinkTrade will previously verify the system and perform a proof of solvency of the bitcoins.
In other words, every time the bitcoins are moved from multisignature cold storage to hot storage, we perform a complete check of the system.

The hot wallet is kept in the servers of blockchain.info and we only keep a small amount of bitcoins to be able to cover the operations of the day.
Further more, all the safety measures of the hot wallet are run by blockchain.info

No exchange in the world is 100% secure. So even though we perform all the security measures, we donâ€™t want to create a bitcoin pot of gold that will challenge hackers to try to compromise the exchange.

We encourage the users to only deposit their bitcoins when they are going to sell them, and not using the exchange to bank on their bitcoins. The safest procedure is to always hold your bitcoins in your wallet until you want to trade them.
